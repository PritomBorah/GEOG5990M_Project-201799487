### Introduction:
Food insecurity has become an alarming isuue in today's world. Political discussions around food insecurity have persisted in the context of the UK's economic downturn and welfare reform. Food has a significant part in shaping people's identities, yet the sharp increase in food banks and food donation locations in stores and educational institutions speaks to the normalisation of food assistance. Furthermore, it is projected that three million people in the UK are at danger of malnutrition (Purdam, 2016).

In this project we are going to find the association between two variable to know if there a strong, moderate or light relation exist among them.
